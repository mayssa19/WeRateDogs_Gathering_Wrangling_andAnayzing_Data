# WeRateDogs_Gathering_Wrangling_andAnayzing_Data

## Project Overview
The main goal of this project is to wrangle and analyze WeRateDogs Twitter data and further creating interesting visualizations with meaningful insights. 
The project is divided into three parts: 
- Data wrangling including gathering (from three sources data), assessing and cleaning.  
- Storing, analyzing and visualizing the wrangled data.
- Reporting 1) the data wrangling efforts and 2) data analyses and visualizations. 

This project was completed as part of Udacity's [Data Analyst Nanodegree](https://eu.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002) certification.

## Data Origin and description. 
The data used in this project is the tweet archive of Twitter user [@dog_rates](https://twitter.com/dog_rates) also known as [WeRateDogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WeRateDogs). 
WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because "they're good dogs Brent." WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.

## Workflow summary
The data was collected from different sources, assessed (by identifying data issues visually and programmatically) and then cleaned. Once cleaned, the data resulted in two analytics-ready datasets where simplified analysis was conducted and some key insights provided with specifiv visualizations.
