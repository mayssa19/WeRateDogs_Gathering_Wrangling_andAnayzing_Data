    "> In the wrangling part of this project, I **firstly** manually downloaded The WeRateDogs Twitter archive and then uploaded it to the project workspace. Once uploaded, I used pandas library to read the csv file. \n",
    "> **Second**, I have downloaded the tweet image pedictions programmatically using the Requests library and stored the TSV file in a new folder in the workspace.\n",
    "> **Third**, I used Tweepy to query the Twitter API after generating the Consumer API keys,the Access Token and Access Token Secret. Then, I stored the JSON data in tweet_json.txt file. The text file was afterward read using the open() and readlines() functions. Finally, the tweet_id, retweet_count and favorite_count were extracted from the file and stored into a dataframe df_tweets."

As I was fixing this issue, I found some names that needed further correction such as \"Johm\" to \"John\" and \"Jessiga\" to \"Jessica\".\n",

    "For issue #4, I used data query to return the records where numerator_rating is higher than 20 => 25 rows had invalid values that were either wrongly extracted from the text, or given collectively (rate more than one dog). These values were corrected one by one. However, some were not possible to be replaced as they were given by the user that way (considered as outliers). \n",
    "For issue #5,unlike what's done in the second issue, here, I looked for the missing names (value = None), and tried to extract the dog name if possible. Otherwise, the row is dropped.  \n",
